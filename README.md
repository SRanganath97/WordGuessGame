Welcome to the word guessing game! To play please install the packages from requirements.txt and run the command 
```bash

This will run the game with the given file as input. If you are unable to install the packages from requirements.txt, 
please install the latest version of python,  nltk and  pygame to play the game with its full functionalities. However the game will work with
most versions of python and nltk, with pygame being an **optional** add on for sound.

To play, please start a new game by pressing y when prompted. Keep guessing letters until you get the word correctly or your score drops below 0.
You can start a new game by pressing y again or end the game by pressing n. Please note that the game will play a sound for every correct and incorrect guess.
